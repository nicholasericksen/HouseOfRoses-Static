<p>The Don&#8217;t Tell Them What You Can Do, Show Them Mindset is the key to begin bringing ideas into the physical world. When we begin telling our self not to tell others what we are doing but rather show them, we begin forcing our self into action. Many people have great ideas but allow the satisfaction of talking about them to end the movement towards the idea. Bring ideas into the physical world and show them to others. If you do this, you will then be on your way to making your dreams become a reality.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Patience ………………………………………… Patience …………………………………………………………… Patience.</p>



<p>Having Patience can take quite a bit of patience. Patience may be one of the hardest hurdles to overcome when trying to become successful. But why be patient?</p>



<p>You did all this work, you put in the time and you made the sacrifices that you needed to make in order to achieve your goals. So why now do you now have to be patient to achieve success?</p>



<p>Well because not everything in life happens right away, for example consider farming. Farming is a labor demanding job. Farming has (6) basic steps that every farmer must make in order to grow plants, vegetables, fruits, exedra. These steps when broken down can act as a perfect simile to the patients needed to achieve your goals.</p>



<p><strong>1.) Crop Selection</strong>&nbsp;– Here the Farmer must decide on the seeds to plant.</p>



<p>* Here the successful person must decide on what type of goal they wish to accomplish.</p>



<p><strong>2.) Land Preparation</strong>&nbsp;– Here the Farmer must choose land and preparing it for the seeds.</p>



<p>* Here the successful person must begin laying down a plan for how to achieve their goals.</p>



<p><strong>3.) Seed Sowing</strong>&nbsp;– Here the Farmer must begin planting the seeds into the soil.</p>



<p>* Here the successful person must take action and start working according to their plan.</p>



<p><strong>4.) Irrigation</strong>&nbsp;– Here the Farmer must constantly water the crops to ensure their growth and development.</p>



<p>* Here the successful person must nurture the dream of their goal and continuously work on achieving it with faith in achieving the goal.</p>



<p><strong>5.) Crop Growth</strong>&nbsp;– Here the Farmer begins to see his crops rising from the soil.</p>



<p>* Here the successful person begins to see progress and results on their goals.</p>



<p><strong>6.) Harvesting</strong>&nbsp;– Here the Farmer begins to finally harvest fruits, vegetables, exedra from their crops.</p>



<p>* Here the successful person finally experiences results from their efforts.</p>



<p>___________________________________</p>



<p>Most people give up on stage (4).</p>



<p>After moving through a labor-intensive stage (3), most people feel as if they are finished and are ready for their reward. They don’t realize that after all the hard work there is still time until their goals become realized.</p>



<p>In order for our goals to be realized, our hard work needs to be backed with faith through the (Irrigation Process), then will start growing through (Crop Growth), then finally may become ready to be realized during (Harvesting).</p>



<p>To be truly successful we need to do the work, but also we must be patient and have faith in the process. After all the work is done, it’s now up to mother nature and her perfect timing. We must remain confident, keep up on our schedule, work hard and be patient.</p>



<p>Your harvest season may just be around the corner!</p>

<p></p>



<p>Change, it instills fear into many. Change is about new beginnings and new experiences. Change is the ONLY thing consistent throughout our whole life.</p>



<p>So why are many people afraid of it?</p>



<p>For one, we are beings of habit. Breaking our habits is tough and can make us feel uncomfortable. It’s always easier to take a clear path that has been walked on than to start our own.</p>



<p>Also, just as in nature, we are lazy and always seek to take the path of least resistance.&nbsp;An example of this&nbsp;can be seen in water. Water will rarely flow uphill, but will flow downhill every time with ease. Water flowing downhill is the path of least resistance. In order for water to flow uphill but that would require more effort such as using a pump or being in an area of high pressure.</p>



<p>Change takes work which most people try and avoid.</p>



<p>Another reason people hate change is because as we age we become more resistant towards trying new things. We hit a point where we feel that we can gage what we’re good at and what we’re not good at.</p>



<p>Avoiding change helps reduce the feeling of defeat or embarrassment. People avoid constantly challenge themselves, typically because of past experiences and the fear of looking foolish.</p>



<p>Another major reason people fear change is due to the uncertainty of the future even though it is only temporary uncertainty.&nbsp;Change has many initial questions when introduced such as: Will this be effective? How will others handle it? How will I handle it? Could there be negative impacts?</p>



<p>People always fear what they do not know and the results of change is not always a clear picture.</p>



<p>Change is the ONLY thing consistent in life and the outcomes are unknown. We must all gage the positive and negatives impacts. If the positives outweigh the negatives then it is beneficial. If the negative out weighs the positive, then it may be time to re-organize our plans.</p>



<p>Learn to embrace change and continue growing.</p>



<p>Change is like the movement of water. Running water is always clean and healthy. Stagnant ponds are always filled with disease and bacteria. Humans have the power to pump the pond water out and start it moving again. Don’t be a stagnant pond. Embrace change and get your water moving again.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Anything in life is achievable, if we are willing to put in the work and make sacrifices to achieve our goals. We must first envision, through our imagination, what it is that we want and then think about how we will feel once we’ve achieved our goal.</p>



<p>Once we are certain on what we want, we must then plan the proper steps to take in order to achieve our goals. Our initial plan may not be the perfect route to achieving our goals, it may even fail along the way. But believe me, every time our plan fails we will be one step closer to achieving our goals.</p>



<p>Our failures will show us where our plan is faulted and gives us the opportunity to find a better route to achieve our goals.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is easier said then done. Many things seem simple in theory but difficult in practice.</p>



<p>For example: the secret to having a healthy/fit body is no secret at all. In order to have a healthy body that’s fit, you must eat healthy foods and workout. Unfortinatley in society not everyone is healthy and fit, some people don’t care to be while others wish that they were.</p>



<p>For those out there who wish to achieve their goals but for some reason can’t:</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re struggling to be healthy and fit or struggling for anything else. The only reason that you cannot achieve your goals is because you are not willing to sacrifice what you know you must.</p>



<p>In order to gain anything in this life, something must be sacrificed. Whether it’s our time, the foods we like to eat or events we must miss. Something must be sacrificed if we intend to achieve any of our goals and arrive at something new.</p>



<h4>To become who or what you want to be in life:</h4>

<p>The world we live in can be stressful and energy demanding. It can be overwhelming and complex. At times, everyone needs an escape from the world, an escape from reality, an escape from obligations.</p>



<p>This escape is something that all people need. Finding our Escape is critical to our mental health and overall happiness. Life isn’t all about constant movement and work. It is critical to slow down at times and enjoy the little things.</p>



<p>It’s important to clear our mind and give it some time to relax and go about its own natural thought patterns. In a world of constant movement, here are some ways to slow down so that we may enjoy the little things:</p>



<h4>Some ways of escaping from life:</h4>



<ul><li>Spending time with our Family</li><li>Working out</li><li>Listening to Music</li><li>Meditating</li><li>Picking up a Hobby</li><li>Vacationing from Work</li><li>Traveling</li><li>Spending time with friends/meeting new ones</li></ul>



<p>Each escape is a time where personal responsibilities and obligations can be temporarily forgotten. This allows our mind to veer off its training and to go back to its natural thought patterns.</p>



<p>You need to find what works for you, I cannot emphasize enough how important finding an escape is. Without one, we become conditioned to the environments we are forced into. We become people with personalities based off our responsibilities and obligations.</p>



<p>We forget our natural thought patterns and who we actually are as individuals. Remember, all work and no play makes jack a dull boy. Don’t become dull! Find your escape and never loose who you are.</p>
